# Project Analysis: Supervision Efficiency Planner

## Executive Summary

The **Supervision Efficiency Planner** is a business case engine designed to demonstrate the financial and operational viability of shifting supervision duties from Clinical Directors to Peer Supervisors (CRSS).

The application models this shift not as an expense, but as an investment, by quantifying three distinct value streams:

1.  **Hard Cash Flow**: Revenue generated by repurposing high-cost Director time from low-value supervision to high-value billable services (e.g., Outpatient Counseling).
2.  **Labor Efficiency**: Cost savings achieved through labor arbitrage—paying a CRSS to supervise is significantly less expensive than paying a Clinical Director.
3.  **Operational Stability**: Financial savings from reduced staff turnover, driven by improved supervision ratios and reduced burnout.

**Strategic Goal**: To automate the "ROI Pitch" for Clinical Peer Supervision, providing data-driven evidence to support staffing changes.

## Strategic Logic Review

The financial modeling within the planner distinguishes between "Hard" (Cash Flow) and "Soft" (Value) metrics, a critical distinction for credibility with financial stakeholders. Below is an analysis of the core logic and key considerations for decision-making.

### 1. Utilization & Revenue Realization
The model calculates "Realized Revenue" based on freed Director hours.
*   **Logic**: `Freed Hours * Utilization Rate * Billable Rate = Revenue`
*   **Consideration**: The default utilization rate (e.g., 75%) accounts for administrative friction. It is crucial to ensure that freed time is genuinely repurposed for billable activities rather than absorbed by general administration. The model allows for sensitivity analysis on this rate.

### 2. Scenario B: Internal Promotion
In this scenario, a Frontline CRS is promoted to CRSS to take on supervision duties.
*   **Logic**: The primary cost is the wage differential between the two roles.
*   **Consideration**: This model assumes a "Headcount Neutral" approach. Management must ensure that the promoted staff member's previous caseload is either absorbed by the remaining team or that the reduction in their billable output is outweighed by the Director's new billable output.

### 3. The "Double Dip" Prevention
The model strictly enforces a mutual exclusivity rule between Revenue and Cost Savings to ensure financial integrity.
*   **Rule**: "If Revenue > 0, Labor Arbitrage is treated as a SOFT metric. If Revenue == 0, Labor Arbitrage is treated as a HARD metric."
*   **Impact**: This prevents the fallacy of claiming to save the Director's salary *while simultaneously* using their time to generate new revenue. This conservative approach strengthens the credibility of the ROI calculation.

### 4. Transition Costs & Break-Even
The Break-Even analysis incorporates one-time transition costs.
*   **Logic**: `Break-Even Months = Transition Costs / Net Monthly Hard Cash Flow`
*   **Consideration**: Transition costs should include recruiting fees, training hours, and administrative setup. Accurately capturing these one-time expenses ensures a realistic timeline for ROI.

| **Headcount** | Static | Static (Headcount Neutral) | +1 FTE |
| **Operational Risk** | Burnout / Turnover | Caseload Displacement | Higher Initial Cash Outlay |
| **Financial Upside** | None (Status Quo) | High (Low Cost, High Revenue) | Moderate (Higher Cost, High Revenue) |
